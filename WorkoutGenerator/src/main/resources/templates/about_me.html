        Hi, I am the author of this website. There is a long story of how and why this website came to life. If you would like to get familiar with this story
        and also you would like to get to know me a little bit better then this article is for you.
    </div>
        <br>
    <div>
        I was always an active person. I loved to play all kinds of sports and have fun with friends just by running around and looking for trouble.
        That led me to chose my field of study which after few years I have finished and became Master of Physical Education at University of Technology in Opole.
        Around that time I started to think what I really would like to do in my life (I know it was kind of late to think about this type of thing
        and it is embarrassing but at least I got a story to tell). Then I started thinking about becoming a software developer.
        My older brother who is an outstanding Java Developer helped me to gather resources to learn and to take my first steps in this journey.
        Next thing you know I have a website... Just kidding. My main source of knowledge was Internet, but also a friend of mine who helped my a lot
        to understand Spring framework and of course my brother who is always there when I need help. My main programming language is Java.
        There were moments when learning to code was hard and nerve wrecking but in the end I love it and I take big pride in what I can create.
        I have grown to welcome solving errors and finding in it lots of pleasure. After some time I started to create my own projects what led me to where I am now.
        If you would like to know more about my abilities there are plenty of ways to discover them on this website (My Experience tab, you can download my CV, check my social media or just contact me).
        I still like to workout and be active but now I am also capable of programming.
    </div>
        <br>
    <div>
        Some time has passed since I started my journey and now I am looking for a job as Junior Java Developer.
        I am hard working, determined and persistent. I like to develop myself and I look for opportunities to learn more about programming and software development.
        I am surrounded by people who are great software developers and they help me to find resources to improve my skills as Java Developer.
        I would like to finally be a part of software engineers team, to work on bigger projects and find my place in that environment.

        I really hope you enjoyed the story. Have fun exploring my website.
