        My experience is what I have created. There are two main Java projects which fused into a third one. That third project is
        this website.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        First project is "Workout Journal". This is my first big project which includes Java, Spring, Hibernate, Angular 8 and MySQL.
        It is a Spring Boot project which lets you keep track of your workout days. Working on this project gave me experience in using CRUD operations,
        understanding how to handle http request and how to connect all of these components.

    </div>
    <br>
    <div>
        The other project is "Workout Generator". This is more interesting one, in which my brother pushed me to construct program that will
        generate random workout plan based on information like advancement level. This project includes Java, Spring, Hibernate, Thymeleaf, MariaDB, jQuery, AJAX.
        Creating generation of random workout plan logic was challenging by itself but as the project was growing I started to incorporate it on a website.
        Next I thought that I would like to have both my projects on one website. I decide to rebuild my previous project (Workout Journal) so that it uses thymeleaf and in some places
        jQuery and AJAX for some dynamics. I have successfully connected both of them and added some frontend. You can see it working after logging in on this website.
        <br>
        WEBSITE DATABASE: In the end I have chosen to use h2 as the final database for this website. Reason behind this, is that it will be less demanding for the server and
        I believe the sever will be very rarely refreshed. After all it's a showcase website.

        My other abilities is working with Git, Docker, Unit Testing (with Mockito) and using IntelliJ IDEA as my IDE.
